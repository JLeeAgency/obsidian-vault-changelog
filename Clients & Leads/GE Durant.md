# GE Durant

Ok, so we have Attune, Travelers, Liberty Mutual, Thimble, NEXT, who can possible do the Workers Comp with a competitive rate, at least off the top of my head.

It looks like I just fudged the numbers with rough guesses for the Durant's general liability Coterie quote. I'm a genius. [[Coterie]]

Records showed 1 owner, 1 employee, approximately $80,000 in gross annual revenue, and approximately $32,500 in annual payroll.

Ok time to work on the quotes:
- **Attune** - Ineligible
- **Travelers** - Ineligible
- **Liberty** **Mutual** - Ineligible
- **Thimble** - Ineligible based on payroll amount (they're *very* careful and observant of quote changes, becareful next time)
- **NEXT** - Ineligible
- **Nationwide** - Needs minimum 3 years in business. Ineligible.
- **BTIS** - $2050~
- **Hull & Co** - but meh...
- **==Ascendant==** - $1510
- 

Unable to find EIN number for Freedom Residential LLC, not on Sunbiz or any other company data profile website. Gotta wait on Gordon to reply to my text [[2023-11-30-Thursday]]. 

Gordon replied with EIN, **88-4185177**. Installation, repair, and maintenance of heating and cooling systems for residential and commercial clients; no petrol work.

Interesting, Thimble uses a minimum payroll amount of $26,000 in order to be eligible for worker's comp. 

Presented quote via email; Gordon responded that we'll have to put a pin on it till February. A Close CRM reminder was set for 2024-01-25.
