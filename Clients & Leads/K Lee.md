#client notes for Katheria Lee.

**2023-11-30** - **06:24 PM** Doing a policy check. Currently, her auto policy is one vehicle with Nationwide at $1412.61/6 mos ($250.63/mo). The vehicle is a 2017 Mercedes-Benz C300.

Received Nationwide notice 08-27 that she didn't set up the telematics discount (30 days notice since applying the discount). Nationwide removes the telematics discount after 45 days if not set up.

> **Notice** Aug 27, 2023 - Usage Based Insurance Program, Discount May be Removed
The SmartRide Mobile program requires that at least one driver on a policy be Fully Registered (on Usage Based Insurance screen, App Status field) within 45 days of program enrollment, or their program will be cancelled. 30 days have elapsed since this policy was enrolled in the SmartRide Mobile program. To prevent the program from cancelling within the next 15 days, at least one driver on the policy needs to download, activate their SmartRide Mobile app and record at least 1 driver-designated trip. Reminder emails have also been sent to the member regarding their need to comply.

Raised premium by about $92/6 mos. Quoting out re-adding the telematics discount and seeing if adding alarm and recovery device under anti-theft will help. And note to self her current coverages are:
- 100/300/50 P14 $1000 ded CO 1000 CP 500 UM 10/20 ERS

Issued policy change for her to re-enroll in [[SmartRide]]; she goes from $1412.61 to $1320.68/6mos. Now to remarket...
