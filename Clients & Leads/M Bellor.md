**2023-12-09** - Matt received Citizen’s [[Depopulation Letter]], has until 2023-12-19 before he’s transferred to Slide at a premium of $2,860/yr increasing from $2,353/yr /file
2860/2353=
Interestingly, this is more than the 20% threshold.
- [ ] Call Citizens to see if this offer is truly valid if it’s not within the 20% threshold.
- [ ] Work up Slide quote myself to see if I can beat their depop offer.
But still will prepare quotes in advance in case they want to depopulate Matt regardless of the rule.
- [x] Remarket quotes 

With Matt as main applicant is pictured. Switching applicant to Ann is same.
