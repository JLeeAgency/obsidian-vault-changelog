- Edison - Winning quote so far FMQ22825076
	- $5307 prior to EUR → **$3,591.87/yr, Edison will only write with 5% hurricane deductible, EZLynx quote was with 2%.**

**2023-12-09** - Received prior dec page and wind mit (2020, not reflective of 2023 roof), fine-tuning Edison quote. Confirmed that lender JPMorgan Chase Bank has their loan information on [[MyCoverageInfo]], so policy can be updated there. I should create list of lenders that use MyCoverage Info on  [[Updating Lenders on Homeowners Policy Changes]].
