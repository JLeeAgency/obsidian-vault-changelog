Sammao called today **2023-12-04** due to receiving cancellation notice in the mail. Investigated and found that Southern Oak cancelled policy backdated to policy effective date of 2023-11-11 due to not receiving initial payment. Advised Sam that notice of policy changing carriers was [faxed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dlZMh6kg4uPVIa3hgleT3L5hCljbEcLy/view?usp=drive_link) 2023-11-17 and payment should have been processed 2 weeks ago as per team notes; we will look into issue and update him tomorrow.

UW memo was printed 12-01.
