So this will be a prototype of a lead's notes page. I think it'd be good to get a history of all [[Opportunity]] interactions and quick, dirty lead/quoting notes. This is better than doing this in Mem due to the fact we have real templates in [[ðŸ’Ž Obsidian]].

**02:44 PM** - Received payment info 12:30 pm but this is for her mom's auto app, [[KR Presley]]. Osceola Lawn Care Inc commercial auto app with Nationwide needs to:
- [x] First confirm that the accidental cancellation was reversed
	- Clear, policy still in force.
- [x] Send Victoria ID cards **ASAP** and remember to save in [[Agency Drive]]
- [x] Create endorsement to apply and enroll in telematics discount
- [x] Take payment via EFT (though I recall customer service advised Victoria can do this online and should have ability to create/access an account with policy number)

So I can't find the quotes... never mind NOW I remember, it was in a daily note.

Good job Jon, it was in there and it led me to the correct email with the quotes:
- **Citizens**Â - $3,083  
- **American Mobile Insurance Exchange**Â - $1,950  
	- [Link to quote here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DFnLBRxeKm1KU9ykLXr-ZEeVuEdZuwpn/view?usp=drive_link)  
- **Aspera**Â - $4,812  
- **Foremost STAR**Â - No
- t writing in FL currently.  
- **American Traditions**Â - $2,439  
- **American Integrity**Â - Not writing in 34142 currently. *Also, this is the client's current policy at $6,605.48/yr.* 

The closest runner-up was American Traditions, but bumping coverage A to match her current American Integrity policy kicked the premium up to ~$3,350/yr. <u>But the biggest issue is that they also cap liability coverage limits at $100k.</u>

Next runner-ups are Citizens (also caps liability coverage at $100k) and Aspera, which I'm investigating now.

[Aspera Kinsale quote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NToYMvreNV0mCqqu3hHu4dJ2kANPxg-B/view?usp=drivesdk) reviewed and still saving compared to current American Integrity policy ($5312.90 vs $6605.48) and matches exact coverages.
