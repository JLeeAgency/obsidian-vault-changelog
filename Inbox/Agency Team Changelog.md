This note is intended to be an unformatted, messy repository of bite-sized updates to our tech platforms and systems. Changes listed here are subject to… change 😂

- As part of the new project in reducing our agency expenses, I’ve been testing out the Kanban plugin as a potential replacement for [[Close CRM]]’s Opportunity Pipeline view. It might be simpler and easier for us to just dump every thing inside Obsidian because of how powerful and capable plugins can be. On another hand, we have a potential out-of-the-box solution in [[Hubspot CRM]] which you guys should have received email invitations to set up accounts for. Much more affordable than Close CRM, and actually offers a lot of the same features and is very polished, has an insane amount of integrations and very scalable, *but still is a separate platform to potentially switch to as part of our workflow*. I’d like your guys thoughts on this sometime. %%You can use the command palette or slash command to leave comments.%%
	- In that same line of thought, Close CRM Leads are already being slightly replaced with how we use client notes.
	- Experimenting with Katelyn’s idea on creating structured client notes but with the “Meta Bind” plugin so that certain lines can be tied to metadata (like the ones we use at the top of notes) which can be used to create data views and analysis reports, similar to the “Smart Views” feature of Close CRM.
	- The only weakness of this idea would be that we’d have to start manually entering/tracking calls, texts, and emails unless we figure out a Zapier automation for this.
- Added “Highlightr” plugin since the built-in one only had blue as the color (sometimes I want to highlight red for bad or green for good, lol). Swapped out the highlight button in the text editing hover bar at the top of notes. Gotta select the text you want to highlight first.
