Closing the loop usually relates to resolving service issues in general or underwriting memos, but really should apply to all of our operations in general.

It means following up with resolving an issue until we know for sure, by obtaining confirmations and receipts, that the issue is fully resolved and the policy is in good standing and the client is satisfied.

Example: A carrier, Southern Oak, notifies us that they still haven’t received payment for a new homeowners policy we [[bound]]. We reach out to the lender, who confirm that they’ve sent payment.

We need to continue to follow up at regular intervals with the lender and the carrier, whether by checking statuses online or by directly reaching out, until we know payment has been made.

We do this again to make sure payment has been processed and the policy is [[Issuance|issued]].
