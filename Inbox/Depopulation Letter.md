Citizens essentially tries to shoo people away to other carriers by allowing [[private-market carriers]] to make quote offers, essentially bids, for Citizens customers policies. It’s not meant to be evil, there’s a [[Citizens - the carrier of last resort|good reason for this]].

If any of those offers are within 20% of what the customer is currently paying for their Citizens policies and at similar coverage levels (though there’s no way that I’m currently aware of to verify the coverage levels), then the customer becomes no longer eligible for Citizens and must be transferred over to the depopulation carrier.

Clients usually get a two month and then one month letter in advance letting them know of this potential change.

We do have the opportunity to try to quote them with other carriers (not all carriers have this arrangement with Citizens to be able to offer bids) and try to get our clients a better deal. Depopulation transfers aren’t always bad; it’s uncommon, but sometimes a customer will get an offer that’s lower than the Citizens policy’s premium, but most times it’s higher.

It almost seems like a forced and unexpected rate increase from the clients’ point of view, which is why prompt responses and empathetic communication is key here.
