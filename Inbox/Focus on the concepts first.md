Like most procedures in an independent insurance agency, it’s important to understand the “concepts” behind the steps of each procedure instead of focusing on how every specific carrier we work with does things. 

**We work with over 30 carriers**, and they all with different systems and tools. And those systems and tools update and change all the time. Therefore focusing on each individual step with each individual carrier is the wrong focus to have.

The terms carriers and underwriters use, and their processes, are generally the same. The small details and specific how-tos do matter, and we’ll have guides on those where we can, but if you can understand the core concepts first, you have the power to navigate *any* carrier’s platform.

That said, most topic notes that have procedures that you need to learn will start off with this as a foreword and the concepts related to that topic.
