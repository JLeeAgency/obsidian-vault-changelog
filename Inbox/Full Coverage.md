In Florida, full coverage auto insurance typically includes [[State Minimum Liability Coverage]] requirements, as well as [[Comprehensive coverage]] and [[Collision coverage]]. 

It's important to note that "full coverage" does not imply complete liability protection, and drivers may choose to purchase additional coverage for better protection.
