#### Loss History Report (LHR)
A document that provides a record of past insurance claims made by a policyholder. This report typically contains detailed information about each claim, including the date of the loss, type of loss, claim status, and amount paid by the insurance company to settle the claim.
**Usage**: In insurance, an LHR is used by underwriters and agents to assess the risk of insuring a potential client. By reviewing an individual's or business's loss history, insurance professionals can determine the likelihood of future claims, which influences premium rates and policy terms.

#### Prior Insurance Report (PIR)
A Prior Insurance Report (PIR) is a summary of an individual's or business's insurance history, showing previous coverage that has been held. This report may include details such as the insurance provider, policy number, coverage types, policy limits, and dates of coverage.
**Usage**: The PIR is used to verify that a prospective insured has maintained continuous coverage and can be eligible for certain discounts or preferential rates. It's also an important tool to detect any gaps in coverage that might suggest increased risk.

#### Enterprise Underwriting Report (EUR)
An EUR is essentially just an umbrella term for PIR and LHR combined into one report and used in the same manner for underwriting risks. So if you see this term, just know that itâ€™s referring to the other reports mentioned above.

#### Motor Vehicle Report (MVR)
A [[Motor Vehicle Report]] (MVR) is an official record from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles that details a driver's licensing status, traffic violations, accidents, and other driving-related information.
**Usage**: Insurers use MVRs to evaluate an individual's driving history, determine insurance premium rates, and assess risk. Clean MVRs typically lead to lower premiums, while records with violations or accidents result in higher rates or even make an otherwise eligible driver ineligible with a carrier.
