“Issuance” is the holy grail or state of Nirvana that we aim to achieve for our policies and policyholders.

It’s when a [[bound]] policy (as an application) passes all the carrier’s underwriting checks and reviews, all required documents have been submitted and processed by the carrier, the binding payment has been made by the client (or mortgage company) and billing in good standing, when a policy becomes issued by the carrier, confirming coverage at least until the renewal date.

This is the crux of what makes an insurance agency a lucrative business. Once a policy is issued, it should be happily ever after for you, the team, and the client, because we shouldn’t hear from the company or the client again unless there’s a claim or if we want to send a Christmas card.

A common woe I hear from clients is:
```dialogue
left: Client
right: Jon
titleMode: first

< I signed up with X agency, but every time my premium keeps changing up and down (not at renewal time, mid-cycle).
> That’s strange. Because if the agent did everything right, which is entering all the information accurately and making sure to only include discounts we’re definitely eligible for and not putting on things we’re supposed to, or at least ones we can’t get away with, then there should be no reason for it to change… unless it's renewal time.
```
