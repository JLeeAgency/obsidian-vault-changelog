Usually I have this on second monitor.

I hate when they select every type, because they probably aren’t looking for every type…

I’m gonna try for just GL and see if he’s actually interested.

Liberty Mutual - If it was **preferred** I would have gone through with the quote. But “acceptable” just means “we might take him”. This isn’t likely to be a competitive quote, vs Coterie who lists home renovations as a targeted business class. If he replies with some interest and Coterie isn’t winning, THEN I’ll do Liberty and Nationwide.

Nationwide -

Hull & Co - but they’ll say they can write *anything* 
Coterie - $991/yr if installments, $958/yr if paid in full [quote snapshot](https://kit.coterieinsurance.com/snapshot/de14ffce-d3fd-46ff-82dd-1296d80f0bfa)
NEXT - Ineligible

I set reminder for 2 days for my follow up text. Honestly, this was just based off intuition which is based on how many correct details I found about the business.

ALSO, if he answered purposefully incorrectly for all the options on the form, it means he definitely exists. As opposed to a fake lead created by All Web Leads made to ‘look real’. That’s why I set reminder for 2 days.

The fact, he simply maxed out all the options… makes this ‘colder’ as a lead. I’m not so sure about this now.

This looks like he actually does business from home, but has a virtual business address (like me) at this executive center.

I’m going to leave lessors premises additional insured on because *maybe* he actually has an office there.
Leased equipment makes sense for a home remodeler.
Construction contract, same as above.
Primary/Non-contributory and waiver of subrogation are often required for any GL policy.

I’m actually going to take off a few of the AI conditions and confirm with him first before I scare him away with a high premium that I may not need to include.

Except P and NC and Waiver of Subro, those are definitely needed.
