The mortgagee clause shows that the mortgage lender is protected under the homeowners insurance policy, which is required in a mortgage agreement.

The mortgagee clause can vary, even if it appears to be the same bank/mortgage company, they may actually want the clause to list their subsidiary or parent company. For example, Shellpoint actually wants the mortgagee clause to list their parent company Newrez LLC.

This is why it’s important to verify exactly how the lender requires the mortgagee clause to show on the policy documents, otherwise they won’t accept proof of coverage which can delay a home sale from closing and delay our carrier partner from being paid which prevents us from being paid.

#### But there are a lot of different mortgage lenders?
And they can change their company structure which requires a change of mortgagee clause. For our active policies, we don’t need to worry about this because the mortgage company will typically contact the carriers and make the updates themselves.

But for new policies, this can be inconvenient in keeping a truly accurate list of mortgage clauses. Which is why it’s better to [[Focus on the concepts first]].

**The concept is to acquire the skill on knowing how and where to find mortgagee clause information.** This information can usually be found:
- On the mortgage lenders website
- The client’s prior policy documents (consider that the mortgagee clause on the prior policy documents may not be accurate, so it’s worth confirming with the client if ‘lender company’ is still the same company servicing their loan). Typically, homeowners get mail or email whenever their loan servicer changes.
- The best method, *but also the most time-consuming*, calling/emailing the mortgage lender directly.
