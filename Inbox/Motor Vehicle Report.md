During the quoting process for personal auto insurance, MVRs come into play early on:

< Hi,I'd like to get an auto insurance quote.
# After some time gathering basic initial information
> Now, in the last 5 years, have you (or any other drives in the household if there are any) had any at-fault accidents, moving violations like speeding tickets, or license suspensions?
```
1. **Gathering Information**: As an agent, you collect necessary personal information from the client, including their driver's license number. You must inform the client that an MVR check is part of the quoting process. It’s best practice to ask up front. Encourage clients to be upfront about their driving history, as the MVR will disclose all details anyway, and we have carrier options for most clients’ situations. This will help avoid any surprises in the quoting process.
   
2. **Running the MVR**: With the client's details, you request their MVR from the DMV or through an approved third-party service. This usually occurs <u>after initial quote estimates and before finalizing the premium</u>.

1. **Assessing Risk**: Once received, you review the MVR for any violations, suspensions, or accidents that might affect the client's risk profile and, consequently, insurance rates.
   
5. **Adjusting the Quote**: If the MVR uncovers new information not disclosed by the client, such as a recent speeding ticket, the initial quote may be adjusted to reflect the higher risk.
   
6. **Finalizing the Policy**: Before finalizing the insurance policy, ensure all MVR findings are accounted for in the premium and coverage terms.
