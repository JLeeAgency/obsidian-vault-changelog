Allstate 25/50/100 MP CO CP 1000
$1k deductibles, clean MVR no claims, states paying a lot and with Allstate for 10+ years. **Note NO UM**


99 Porsche with Markel probably because it’s an antique/classic
25/50/100 UM CO CP MP 

Nevermind, this is probably his daily driver because he has the 99 porsch 911, *that* is probably his weekend car.

Trying to decide if I want to quote all 3 together but the 911 probably deserves to be on a quote alone with [[Hagerty]], our carrier for antique/classic/high-value vehicles.

Females assigned on the higher value vehicles for rate optimization purposes.

Trying to figure out if they were retired or not because I’m bad at math. If they were retired, I would have excluded work loss.

They don’t have ERS/RR currently, but I’m adding it now because I think it’s a good idea for them to have it.

Forreal. They changed it so its required so I guess we’re adding my name.

>???? 

EZLynx updated their logo and broke their rater. Brilliant. Even if I turned off carriers (which made no carrier questions available) it still gave an error.

interesting, their reporting tool didn’t pick up the Allstate insurance but rather their Markel/Essentia policy.

Actually, that’s gonna hurt our rate/eligibility score because the length of time with that carrier is less than his time with Allstate (10 years * 12 mo) vs 14 mos…

Ohh that’s pretty good.

	- ~$40-45 difference for Enhanced Tier, probably worth it

Goddamn, it, of course they actually have a claim. Oh, it’s for their daughter who doesn’t live with them anymore.

I’ll need to provide proof that they have Allstate for X months

I quoted the antique classic with Safeco, because I remembered that was possible; that and it’d make it a lot simpler to just have all 3 vehicles together.

And that’s it for now. If he comes back and says it’s still higher, then I’ll quote with Foremost/Hagerty.
