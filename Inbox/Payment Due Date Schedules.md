When payment is expected by a carrier is still dependent on that specific carrier, when payments are due to start a policy are still generally is based on policy type.

#### Personal Auto
<u>Typically required upfront</u>, even if the policy effective date is set in the future. This is important because certain carriers, like Allstate, offer a “quote in advance” discount. So to retain the discount the policy needs to start 7+ days in the future, but the client has to pay now. This is counterintuitive to most folks, so care should be handled in communicating this.

All carriers are like this. The only company I’m aware of that allows payment in the future if the effective date is in the future, is State Farm.

#### FIRE
What’s FIRE? See [[FIRE]]. There are two situations here, both of which are set by the agent during the application process. Usually this is at the end, where the application asks “who should be billed upfront” and “who should renewal bills be sent to”.

If the **policyholder** is paying, such as if they own their home outright without a mortgage, then payment is due upfront.

If the property has a **mortgage/loan**, then 99% of the time the bank will require an [[escrow account]] to handle the payment to the carrier (usually to pay in full). Carriers usually allow 15–30 days after a policy is bound for payment before sending out [[Non-Pay Cancellation Notices]].

#### Commercial
<u>Typically required upfront.</u>

BUT, the peculiar thing to keep in mind is if the clients’ company already has existing policies with that carrier. This means that they also have an existing [[Account]].

Any **added** policies, whether Commercial/Business Auto or Worker's Compensation, assume the billing cycle and renewal date of the parent account. For example…

- **2023-05-01** - Osceola Lawn Service Inc started with us for a General Liability policy. This is an annual policy, so the effective date of this policy and their new account with Nationwide is 2023-05-01 to 2024-05-01. They pay monthly, payments due on the 1st.
- **2023-11-23** - They add their commercial autos with us, effective same day. But since the commercial auto policy is added to the account, the payments aren’t due till the 1st (the due date for the account). Also, the added policies start effective 11-23, but even though commercial auto policies *are* *annual*, <u>the quote premium is prorated for, and the renewal date adopts the account’s renewal date of 2024-05-01.</u>
	- So their commercial auto policy dec page will show effective 2023-11-23 to 2024-05-01, but then when it renews it will be 2024-05-01 to 2025-05-01.
