As we know from [[how an insurance agency works]], being able to retain your clients and their policies is important to being a successful agent and running a successful agency. But because of the nature of the independent agent insurance industry.

[[Focus on the concepts first]]

No matter what policy type or what the issue is; checking on whether a policy is in [[good standing]] or not boils down to a few main ideas and the same action plan, every time:

## Establish the baseline
What type of policy is it? With which carrier? Who should be named on the policy? What billing method should they be on and using what payment method? For auto policies, which cars should be insured or what address is the homeowners for? Who is the agent/agency of record?

These details can generally be garnered from the current declaration page for our client, which *should* be saved in the Agency Drive as ‘dec page’ ‘carrier’ ‘first_initial last_name’. If multiple files appear, use the most recent one created (files should have a date created, whether in the file name as YYYYMMDD or in their file properties) or confirm with the team member who wrote the policy.
- Locate the client’s current [[declarations page]] for the policy in question.

## Getting caught up to speed
- Review any recent notes by the team or any recent communications with the client. Communicate with the team member who wrote the policy if any details are missing. Places to check are…
	- Leads in Close CRM (at least until the CRM is retired on Dec 25th).
	- Any client notes in Obsidian (`alt + s`  to use Omnisearch for ‘first_initial last_name’).
	- If there isn’t much communication or notes in either of those two, discuss with the team member who wrote the policy and advise them to update their notes in either system; this is important for compliance and protecting the agency’s liability.

## Checking for any changes
- Access the carrier website with login credentials provided in [[1Password]]
	- My favorite method is using the `alt + [` shortcut to open the desktop app’s Quick Access bar. Just type in the carrier and select ‘Open in browser’.

- Here’s where it’s better to think in ‘concepts’ than exact steps… each carrier has different ways of mapping out their platforms. It’s an exercise in futility to try to document and memorize them all. But generally they all use the same terminology, so as long as you know what words to look out for you can find your way around:

### Transactions, Correspondence, and Activities
These are all fancy words for “policy changes” or “requests for information” from the insurance company. Any time you access a clients' policy on a carrier’s website, there *should* exist a menu or page where you can view a history of policy changes. Here are some examples:

title: Not sure what to do or look for?
When all else fails and you don't have or can't find the resources, just call the carrier's agency support department. *Most of the time*, the representatives are more than happy to help with any type of matter including how to quote properly, how to service a policy or do policy changes, or platform-related questions. Trust me, they're very used to get all types of silly questions from agency team members and, most of all, agents.

## Document and creating a plan of action 
If you see that the policy is clear, the billing is up-to-date, there are no outstanding requests for information or letters from the underwriters, you simply need to document such in the CRM under the client’s Lead page.

If there is an issue or memo outstanding, then document such and bring to the attention of the writing team member to discuss a plan of action to resolve the situation, then the team executes the plan and [[Closing the Loop|closes the loop]].
