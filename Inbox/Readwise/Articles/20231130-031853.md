# KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid

The KISS principle, an acronym for "Keep It Simple, Stupid", is a design principle that advocates for simplicity in design and systems. It suggests that systems perform best when they are simple and straightforward, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided[5].

This principle is widely applied in various fields, including business, where simplicity is key to success. It can be applied to projects, processes, products, marketing, and reports, among other areas. The idea is that people are more likely to engage with and understand something that is simple and easy to grasp[1].
