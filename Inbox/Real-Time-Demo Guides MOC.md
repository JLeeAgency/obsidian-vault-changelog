## Real-time-demo guides
Some things are better taught in real-time, like how to handle the unexpected, the “flow” of how to do things and where to check for certain things, and how long tasks generally should take. If I prescribe a certain ‘time goal’ to shoot for, know that I’d only prescribe it if I know it’s doable (agents are notorious for placing crazy expectations).

These also aren’t going to be in any specific order or format; if you have a special request on a process you want demonstrated, let me know.
