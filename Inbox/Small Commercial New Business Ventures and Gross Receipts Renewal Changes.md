>**New Ventures**
>Effective July 26, 2023, we will no longer accept new business submissions for businesses that have been operating for less than 3 years under the same legal entity.
>**Gross Receipts**
>In response to significant inflation impacts, gross receipts for Food Service and Auto Service BOP policies renewing effective October 31, 2023, will be increased to recently communicated new business minimums:
- Limited Cooking – increase to $250,000 ($500,000 in NY)
- Full Cooking - increase to $500,000 ($750,000 in NY)
- Fine Dining - increase to $750,000 ($1M in NY)
- Auto Service - increase to $250,000 ($500,000 in NY)

>For all renewals with current receipts above the new minimums, gross receipts will increase by 20%. Gross receipts may be amended by providing a current Profit & Loss (P&L) statement or an annual sales report to underwriting for review and validation.
