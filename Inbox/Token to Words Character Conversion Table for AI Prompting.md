Useful tip taken from Reddit:
>Keep in mind, ChatGPT is not very proficient at math. Additionally, it struggles with providing content in a specific number of words.
>
>For example, if you request "write this email using a maximum of 300 words", you'll often receive content exceeding 300 words.
>
>This is because ChatGPT and the OpenAI platform operate on a token system, not words. And remember, 1 word is NOT 1 token. In fact, the number of words per token can vary, depending on the complexity of the word.
>
>So, when you need to control the length of your output, make sure to use tokens instead of words.
