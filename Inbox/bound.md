When a policy is “bound” it means that the policy’s application has been submitted and temporary coverage has been confirmed. Payment may or may not be needed for this, depending on [[Payment Due Date Schedules]].

Sometimes, certain quoting eligibility conditions set by the individual carrier have to be met in order for an agent to have “authority” to bind a policy. Ex, the applicant doesn’t have any losses/claims.

You’ll know a policy is bound when a “binder” is generated and downloadable. A "binder" in insurance terms is a written copy of the binding agreement between the insurer and the insured. It serves as temporary evidence of insurance coverage and specifies all the protections for which the insured is covered, as well as any coverage limits, deductibles, fees, and terms and conditions before a formal insurance policy is [[issuance|issued]].
