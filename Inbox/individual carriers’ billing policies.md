Annoyingly, carriers can vary greatly in the billing schedules and payment methods that they accept. And carriers can change this depending on changes in the insurance industry. I believe, at least for now, itâ€™s best to just keep a running list of how each carrier allows policies to be billed.

### Southern Oak
**Billing Options:** 8-Pay, 4-Pay, 2-Pay, Full Payment 
**Accepted Payment Methods:** EFT, credit/debit card
**Misc Notes:** Allows 15 days after effective date for payment if billed through mortgagee.
