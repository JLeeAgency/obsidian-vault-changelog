# ðŸ”® Useful AI Prompts 
A repository for useful AI prompts I've come across with applications to my insurance agency. Content and quality of the prompts are a continuous work in progress; suggestions are welcome.

## Knowledge Management 
- **Simplifying carrier underwriting bulletins**
	- Please provide an executive summary of the attached underwriting memo from the carrier. Focus on extracting and clearly presenting the following key elements: Identity of the insurance carrier sending the memo. Client information, including their name and policy number as stated in the document. Specific reasons cited by the carrier for initiating this communication. Clearly defined tasks the agency must undertake, including any documentation required to comply with the carrier's request. If the memo lacks clarity, suggest actionable steps. Responsibilities of the insured client in this scenario. If not explicit, suggest how the client should be engaged to resolve the matter. Itemize any specific documents or evidence the carrier has requested to be submitted. Highlight the deadline for submission and emphasize the urgency for compliance to prevent policy cancellation. Present your summary in bullet points, using plain, direct language that cuts through the complexity for ease of understanding and action. Ensure your response is structured to prioritize critical aspects and deliver an immediate action plan, reflecting the gravitas of the situation and spurring prompt agency response. Avoid any redundant inclusion of information and be as concise as possible.

## Commercial Quoting 
- **Creating a 'Description of Operations' for a Commercial Lines Quote**
	- Examine the following website closely and generate an accurate and precise 'Description of Operations' for their business, which will be used for quoting a commercial lines policy. Your description must reflect the actual services offered by the firm and operations directly related to those services, excluding any irrelevant details. Additionally, consider potential risk factors associated with their operations while creating the description. Here is the website to evaluate: {{websiteurl}}
	  
	  The description of operations should be around 15 tokens long and non-formatted because it will be entered in a simple text field. Description of operations for insurance purposes should focus more on what the services are; not the staff. This is not an advertisement.
