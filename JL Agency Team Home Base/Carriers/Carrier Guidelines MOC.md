- **2023-12-06 - [[Moratorium]] for Hartford**
	- Effective: 2023-12-06
	- Products: personal auto
	- From an email from Becky, director of operations at SAN of FL:
		- “**IMPORTANT :**  **We can't write any new Personal Auto with Hartford until further notice. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS !  We are expecting that to open back up in January. Until further notice,  the SAN of Florida Producer code: 21211064 is CLOSED FOR NEW BUSINESS FOR HARTFORD AUTO. Hartford is way underpriced for the market.**  They do have a 25% rate increase approved which was just pushed back from late December to January.  As a result, NO new business for Hartford Personal Auto can be written. There are no exceptions. Due to many dwindling number of personal auto carriers willing to write new business, Hartford is getting an unprecedented amount of new business.  Fortunately, our loss ratio has performed well for this market, so we are optimistic about opening up in January. The Moratorium for no new Personal Hartford business is EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.”
