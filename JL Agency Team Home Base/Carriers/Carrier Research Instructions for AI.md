I intend to feed these instructions to an AI agent to generate a directory report of carriers in Florida.

**Assistant's Research Responsibilities:**
As part of the Carrier Directory Research Project, your role is to compile a comprehensive database of insurance carriers in Florida. Your task is to research and accurately populate key data points for each carrier, using the structured format provided, substantiated by credible sources. This directory will serve as an essential tool for our agency, enabling us to make informed comparisons and recommendations to our clients. Precision and consistency in data entry are paramount for the utility and reliability of this resource. These are the key data points, their definitions, where they can most likely be found, and an example of the data point for reference:

- **Year Founded:**
  - Details the inception year of the insurance carrier.
  - This information can usually be found in the "About Us" or "History" section of the carrier's website.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance was founded in 1952."

- **Financial Strength Ratings:**
  - Evaluates the carrier's ability to meet its financial commitments.
  - Ratings can be found on credit rating agency websites such as AM Best, Moody’s, or S&P.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance has an AM Best rating of A (Excellent)."

- **Regulatory Status (Admitted vs. Non-Admitted):**
  - Determines the carrier's compliance with state insurance regulations.
  - Information is typically available on state department of insurance websites or industry databases.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance is an admitted carrier in the state of Florida."

- **Coverage Offerings and Specialization:**
  - Identifies the specific types of insurance products the carrier offers.
  - Details can be gathered from the carrier’s consumer-facing product descriptions and marketing materials.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance specializes in homeowners insurance and flood coverage."

- **Claims Handling and Customer Satisfaction:**
  - Reflects the efficiency and satisfaction with the carrier's claims process.
  - Sources may include third-party review sites, consumer advocacy groups, or independent research firms.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance has a 90% customer satisfaction rating in claims handling."

- **Policy Features and Benefits:**
  - Lists the distinguishing aspects of policies offered by the carrier.
  - The assistant can review policy summaries, brochures, or comparison tables found on public carrier websites.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance policies include a 24/7 claims hotline and a vanishing deductible feature."

- **Discounts and Incentives:**
  - Specifies cost-saving opportunities available to policyholders.
  - Information is typically available on the promotions or discounts section of the carrier’s website.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance offers a multi-policy discount of up to 20% and a safe driver incentive."

- **Technology and Operational Efficiency:**
  - Assesses the carrier's adoption of technology to streamline operations.
  - Reviews and ratings on tech publications or forums might shed light on user experience with the carrier's tech platforms.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance provides a mobile app for policy management and claims filing."

- **Multi-State Operations and Local Expertise:**
  - Explores the geographical range and local knowledge of the carrier.
  - Regional carrier details can be found on "Contact Us" or regional service pages; national presence is often highlighted in the company overview.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance operates in 30 states, with specialized local offices in hurricane-prone areas."

- **Recent Legal Actions and Compliance Issues:**
  - Highlights any recent or significant litigation or regulatory scrutiny involving the carrier.
  - Such information can be obtained from news outlets, legal databases, or the company's own press releases.
  - Example: "Acme Insurance settled a class-action lawsuit in 2022 related to claims adjustment practices."

For each carrier, your output should be in this format:

## Initial carrier list generation 
AI Agent Assistant,

Conduct focused research to identify and list only those insurance carriers that are verified to be licensed and actively issuing personal auto insurance policies in Florida, as of the current month in 2023. Adhere to the three-fold method below:

1. **Up-to-Date Accuracy**:
   - Concentrate on validating current licensure and activity status through cross-referencing the Florida Department of Financial Services, NAIC, and a minimum of one other credible industry database.
   - Ascertain the list reflects the most recent data from these verified sources.

2. **Specificity in Selection**:
   - Strictly include carriers that provide personal auto insurance; rigorously screen out any entities involved exclusively in other insurance lines, such as property-only insurers.
   - Look for explicit confirmation from each source that the carriers are specialized or significantly engaged in personal auto insurance.

3. **List Presentation**:
   - Compile the vetted information into an organized list by name, ensuring alphabetical sorting for immediate clarity.
   - Present only the names without additional details to maintain simplicity and focus.

Please proceed with precision and attention to detail to guarantee the delivery of an accurate, relevant, and accessible report. Your dedication to rigorous source validation and category-specific exclusions is critical to the success of this task.
