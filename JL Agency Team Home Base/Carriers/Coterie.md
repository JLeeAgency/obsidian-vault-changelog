- Application/quote details aren't included in the final policy documents that can be downloaded for a client via their agent dashboard.
	- Scenario: Client wants to see how much it would be to add a Workers Compensation policy which is based on annual payroll and also used in a General Liability quote/application. My first thought was to go back to their quote in Coterie but it no longer exists since it's an active policy now. Usually, policy document packages include the application used with all their entry details (annual revenue, payroll, years of experience, etc.), but Coterie's does not.
	- You can find the annual revenue and annual payroll used if you still have access to either the PDF copy or the Quote Snapshot link; the details are still retained there even after the quoted policy is issued.
