## FIRE in Property and Casualty Insurance
Sometimes you may hear the policy types like homeowners, renters, condominium, personal articles policies, or commercial property get referred to by agents as "Fire" products or policies.

"Fire" is a term that refers collectively to several types of property insurance. It primarily deals with insurance policies that cover properties such as homes, condos, rentals, and other real estate assets. The term "Fire" is from back in the day, when fire was the most common type of property loss and is now used to encompass a variety of coverages.

In essence, these "Fire" policies offer protection against damages caused by a multitude of perils, including fire, of course, but also extending to theft, weather conditions, liability, and more. It's a key category within the broader Property and Casualty insurance environment. 

So when you hear "Fire", think "Property Insurance".
