# Gathering Quote Info

Key questions to ask when working up a quote and details to look out for.

## What happens when a potential client first contacts us, and what I should do as the first point of contact?

The first thing to do is to gather pertinent information **depending on the type, or types, of insurance the client is interested in**. The info needed and questions to ask depends on if their interest is in personal [[auto]], [[homeowners]], [[commercial]] lines, renters, etc. The lists of key details required for each product along with example word tracks, are listed here.

## Base info required for **all** products
- **_Legal_** **full name**
    - Always confirm spelling
- **Date of birth**
- **Address**
    - Confirm if this should be mailing address as well

## Personal Auto
- **Drivers license**
- **Year, make, and model of the vehicle(s)**
    - VIN would be nice to have if readily available, but we can often find this on our own.
- **If there should be any additional drivers**
    - For each one you'll need full name, date of birth, drivers license.
- **Any accidents, tickets, or license suspensions within the last 5 years**
    - At-fault (AF) and not-at-fault (NAF) accidents.
    - If yes to tickets, ask if they were able to remove the points via taking a traffic safety course or court.
- **Approximately how many miles they drive per year**
    - Most people have no idea, you can say the national average is 12-15,000 mi/yr.

## Homeowners
- **Is this a new purchase?**
    - If yes, you'll need the closing date.
- **Any updates/renovations to the HVAC, Roof, Plumbing, or Electric system?**
    - If yes, you'll need the year they were updated. If they don't know, go for a ball-park estimate, it's important.
