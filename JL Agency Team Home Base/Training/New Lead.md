# Conceptual Overview
In simple terms, a lead in the context of a property and casualty insurance agency is a potential client who has shown interest in the insurance products or services that an agency offers. This interest is often demonstrated by the prospect requesting a quote for insurance products or services.

For example, if a homeowner fills out an online form on the J Lee Insurance Agency's website requesting a quote for homeowners insurance, that homeowner becomes a lead for the agency. The agency can then follow up with this lead, providing them with the requested quote and potentially converting them into a client.

In sales industries, they are often categorized as:

1. **Cold lead**: A cold lead is someone who has not expressed any interest in your insurance products or services and has had no interaction with your agency. They may not even be aware of your company or offerings. Cold leads typically require more effort and time to convert into clients.
	a.) **Example and procedure:** Internet leads. Often these leads are automatically imported into [[Close CRM]] with their pertinent info. Their [[Lead Status]] should be set to 'Potential', as in they are just a *potential* lead prior to qualifying their interest, general eligibility for our carriers, and whether or not our [[draft quote]] is competitive.

2. **Warm lead**: A warm lead is a prospect who has shown some level of interest in your insurance services, such as conducting an online search, submitting their information to your company, or spending time on your product page. They are in the early stages of the buying process and may become hot leads with proper nurturing.

1. **Hot lead**: A hot lead, also known as a qualified or sales-ready lead, is a person who has expressed a clear interest in your insurance products and is ready to receive a quote or make a purchase. They are prepared to talk to an insurance agent and finalize their decision.
	a.) Example: A friend of yours just discovered their auto insurance was cancelled without their knowledge and FL DMV sent them a letter stating their license will get suspended if they can't find insurance. They need a policy ASAP.

# Practical Overview & Procedures
In Close's CRM platform, Leads are essentially potential customers or clients. They are designed to collect all of your communication history with a potential customer within one view, and allow you to communicate with your Leads in a number of different ways. By default, Close imports Companies as "Leads." The individuals at that company are seen as "Contacts," and if you are in the process of selling something to that Lead, it is tracked through "Opportunities."

### **Commercial Lines Leads**
For Commercial lines insurance quotes (general liability, workers compensation, business owners policy), your Leads will be Companies where each Lead (Company) will have one or more Contacts. 

### **Personal Lines Leads**
For Personal lines quotes (auto, homeowners, life), your Leads will be Customers, and each Lead (Customer) will have precisely one Contact. The Lead name and Contact name will be the same in this case.
