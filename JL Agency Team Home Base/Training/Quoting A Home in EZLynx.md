# Process
- Start by checking the prospect in the CRM
- Get a copy of the Declaration Page or RCE in Google Drive if this is a Generated Lead
- Gather the information such as: (you may put it in your note or mem, you will need it all throughout the quoting process)
    - Complete Name
    - Date of Birth
    - Property Address
    - Phone Number - Make sure this is accurate. You may verify this in Whitepages.
    - Email Address - a lot of carriers offer paperless discounts nowadays
- Go to EzLynx 
- On the left side of the page, click the File button and choose **Create Applicant**
- Don’t forget to identify the number of people in the household
- Enter the required information such as:
    - Complete Name
    - Date of Birth
    - Marital Status
    - Driver’s License (if you have it or if you are quoting for a PACKAGE (home and auto))
    - Education (if you don’t know this then choose Bachelor, you can always change this once confirmed. This is to get a better rate)
    - Industry & Occupation - do not leave it blank because it does have an influence on their rating.
        - Banking or Sales-Retail/Wholesale because Jon will confirm the information anyway. Use your best judgement and you may put Retired if the client is. 
        - Retirees get discounts with a lot of homeowners companies and a lot of auto industry companies.
            - In Florida, people usually retire at the age of 62, put the years

    - Update to the House
        - Always check the County Property Appraiser
        - Most important is the Water and Roof Update, a lot of insurance carriers in Florida are picky with these
        - Two important things to ask them are the Roofing Update and the Water Heater Update. With everything that’s going on with the homeowner's insurance market in Florida, a lot of carriers are picky about year the water heater is. If it’s older than 15 years, that cuts down our options substantially. They like new water heaters and tankless water heaters

    - Maling Same As Property: The Mailing Address is the same as the Property Address. - This means there is a county closure, they are not doing this particular zip code
- You may put the Homweoner’s Quote Result Template in your current mem
## Homweoner’s Quote Result Template
- Jon has a template, you may cross out the carriers on this template to identify where can we quote the client directly.
- Always put the proposed premium on the template for all carriers that are left
- You need to manually quote all Insurance carriers that are not crossed out from the template but might do it for the client, 
- OLYMPUS INSURANCE - Check the screenshot you took from Citizens and look for the Personal Multiperil Territory
- CITIZENS - can do almost everybody
- FEDERATED NATIONAL - Manual quote is needed but unlikely since they are so expensive.
## Carrier Notes

- AMERICAN INTEGRITY - they only bind properties that are 1 year old and newer
- SEACOAST BROKERS - Those are for multi-unit properties and commercial properties
- BURNS & WILCOX - If you get them, they are not like a pretty carrier, and it’s kind of a pain in the 😀
