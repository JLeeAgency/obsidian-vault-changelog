A place for me to quickly scribble ideas for scripts and communications templates for J Lee Insurance Agency.

**Example call script to give an idea of phone etiquette**

```dialogue
left: Client
right: Team Member "Jane"

> Hey Carlos, this is Jane from J Lee Insurance Agency, how are you?

< Good.

> Just real quick, Jon mentioned we needed the photos of the pool area for your Citizens policy, it's really important that we get those submitted to Citizens. Would you be able to send those today?


< Sure.

> Great, thank you so much, also did you have any questions on your policy I can pass to Jon?

< None at the moment.  

> Great, well thank you for being a client with us Carlos, have a great day!"
```



**Texting a follow-up reminder for required documents** 
"Hi Carlos, this is Julia from J Lee Insurance! Just a friendly reminder from Jon that we still haven't received the photos of the pool area for your Citizens policy. Please send that as soon as when conveniently possible. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to us at the office numberÂ [(239) 355-5587](tel:2393555587). Thank you so much!"
