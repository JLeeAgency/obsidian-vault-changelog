**A quick run down of where everything is now and (most likely) forever will be**

[[ðŸ’Ž Obsidian]] is our shared knowledge base for everything procedural and operational for the agency. This includes how-toâ€™s for everything regarding office procedures and handbook type information, policy management for current clients, carrier guidelines and insurance company information, etc.

Youâ€™re also welcome to use Obsidian as a space for quick, scratch notes for personal use. Itâ€™s a pretty powerful platform.

[[Tango]] is our training guide platform of choice. You should have received an email to set up an account to access the workspace and the guides within.

[[Close CRM]] will be used strictly for sales pipeline and client communications documentation/management.

[[EZLynx]] will be our storage for deeper details regarding clients and prospects, for example a client and their householdâ€™s drivers licenses, vehicle information, and prior/current policy information.
