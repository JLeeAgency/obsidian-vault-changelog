The clients just told you that they want to go with you and your homeowners policy quote. What do you do now?

[[Focus on the concepts first]]
## Key Concepts & Stages
- **Application Preparation & Review** - Make triple-sure all the information entered is correct. When you “submit an application” (or “convert to application” is used by some carriers), you’ll essentially go through the quote again. Sometimes you might have to reenter information. Sometimes additional eligibility questions pop up in certain sections. Other times, you’ll have to run “[[Loss History Reports]]” if they weren’t already ran, which can result in [[Underwriter Referral Scenarios]].
	- **Regardless of carrier, what you’ll want to look for:** Is a button or menu option that says “Submit Application”, “Convert to Application”, or something a long of those lines.

- **Required Supporting Documents** - At this point, it’s clear that the client is definitely eligible for a policy with the carrier. Each carrier has their own set of documentation that needs to be uploaded with an application ([[home inspections]], permits that prove the roof was replaced, proof of current/prior coverage).
	- **Regardless of carrier, what you’ll want to look for:** Is a button or menu option that says “View Required Documents”, “Required Documents”, “Uploads”, “Manage Documents”.
