# Understanding Basic Insurance Terms
We'll want to familiarize you with the foundation of property and casualty insurance. We'll cover key terms like "premium", "deductible", and "coverage limit", and the different types of insurance coverage, such as auto, homeowners, and commercial. We'll also common abbreviations you'll see in communications with team members or our partner companies.

Skim through the terms below and then consolidate your learning and test your knowledge in the [Quizlet Class](https://quizlet.com/join/TqARgSyTs) I've set up where we can review your progress in mastering the material. When testing yourself, I recommend using [these test settings](https://markuphero.com/share/HV9gfPK2yp02217sZF65).

# Level 1 🐣
## Policy Terms
- **Policyholder:** The individual or entity who owns an insurance policy. This could be a person, a family, or a business. For example, if a homeowner purchases homeowners insurance, the homeowner is the policyholder.
- **Premium:** The amount of money the policyholder pays to the insurance company in exchange for insurance coverage. Premiums may be paid annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly. For instance, if a car owner is told that their auto insurance premium is $1,200 per year, they could opt to pay this in $100 monthly installments.
- **Deductible:** The amount a policyholder must pay out of pocket before the insurance company begins to pay on a claim. For example, if a policyholder has a $500 deductible on their auto insurance policy and they have an accident that results in $2,000 of damage, they will pay the first $500 and the insurance company will cover the remaining $1,500.
- **Claim:** A request by a policyholder for the insurance company to cover a loss. For example, if a business experiences a fire, they would file a claim with their commercial insurance company for the damages incurred.
- **Coverage:** The protection provided by an insurance policy, which could include property damage, liability, medical payments, and more. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy typically provides coverage for damage to the home itself, personal property within the home, and liability if someone is injured on the property.
- **Endorsement (or Rider):** A modification to an insurance policy that changes the coverage in some way. This could be adding coverage for a specific item or event,or removing coverage. For instance, a homeowner might add an endorsement to their homeowner's insurance policy to provide additional coverage for a valuable piece of jewelry.
- **Exclusions:** Specific things or events that an insurance policy does not cover. For example, many homeowner's insurance policies exclude coverage for damage caused by flooding.
## Liability Terms
- **Liability:** The legal responsibility for one's actions or omissions. In the context of insurance, liability typically refers to the policyholder's legal responsibility for injuries or damages to other people or their property. For example, if a dog owned by the policyholder bites a neighbor, the policyholder could be liable for the neighbor's medical bills.
- **Bodily Injury Liability:** This part of an auto insurance policy covers the costs associated with injuries to other individuals in an accident where the policyholder is at fault.
- **Property Damage Liability:** This covers the costs associated with damage to someone else's property in an accident where the policyholder is at fault. For instance, if a policyholder backs into a neighbor's fence, their auto insurance policy would cover the cost of repairing or replacing the fence.
- **Personal Liability:** This type of coverage is typically part of a homeowner's insurance policy. It covers legal or medical costs if someone is injured on the policyholder's property.
## Other Important Terms
- **Underwriting:** The process an insurance company uses to determine how much risk is involved in insuring a particular individual or entity, and therefore how much to charge for insurance coverage. For example, an auto insurance underwriter might consider factors like a driver's age, driving record, and the type of car they drive when determining their premium.
- **Insurable Interest:** The policyholder's financial interest in the thing being insured. Essentially, the policyholder would suffer a financial loss if the insured item were damaged or destroyed. For example, a person has an insurable interest in their own car, but not in their neighbor's car.
- **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** The value of an insured item at the time of a loss, taking depreciation into account. For instance, if a five-year-old laptop is stolen, the ACV would be the cost to replace the laptop with a similar five-year-old model, not a brand new one.
- **Replacement Cost:** The cost to replace an insured item with a new one of similar kind and quality. Unlike ACV, replacement cost does not factor in depreciation. For example, if a homeowner's policy provides replacement cost coverage for personal property, a stolen five-year-old laptop would be replaced with a new laptop of similar kind and quality.

# Level 2 🐥
## Claims-Related Terms
- **Adjuster:** An insurance professional who investigates and evaluates insurance claims to determine the extent of the insurance company's liability. For example, after a car accident, an adjuster will assess the damage to the vehicle and determine how much the insurance company should pay for repairs.
- **Appraisal:** The process of determining the value of property, or the extent of damage, often used to determine the amount of a claim. For instance, an appraiser might evaluate a piece of commercial property after a fire to estimate the cost of repairs.
- **Subrogation:** This happens when an insurance company pays a claim and then seeks to recover that money from a third party that was responsible for the loss. For instance, if a policyholder's car is damaged by another driver, the policyholder's insurance company may pay for the repairs and then seek to recover those costs from the other driver's insurance company.
## Coverage Types
- **Comprehensive Coverage (Auto):** This part of an auto insurance policy covers damage to the policyholder's vehicle that is not caused by a collision, such as theft, fire, or vandalism. If a tree falls on a policyholder's car, the damage would be covered under comprehensive coverage.
- **Collision Coverage (Auto):** This coverage pays for damage to the policyholder's own vehicle in an accident, regardless of who is at fault. If a policyholder hits a pole with their car, collision coverage would pay for the damage.
- **Renters Insurance:** A policy that provides coverage for a policyholder's possessions within a rental property, as well as liability for injuries or damages that occur on the premises. For example, if a renter's laptop is stolen from their apartment, their renters insurance policy could cover the loss.
## Business Insurance Terms
- **Workers' Compensation Insurance:** This insurance provides coverage for medical expenses and lost wages for employees who are injured on the job. If an employee at a construction company falls off a ladder and breaks a leg, workers' compensation insurance would cover their medical bills and part of their lost wages while they recover.
- **General Liability Insurance:** This insurance provides coverage for a business if it's responsible for damage to third-party property, bodily injury, or reputational harm. If a customer slips and falls in a store, general liability insurance could cover the customer's medical bills.
- **Commercial Property Insurance:** A type of insurance that covers a business' physical assets, such as buildings, equipment, and inventory, against loss or damage from a variety of causes, such as fire, theft, or vandalism.
## General Insurance Terms
- **Quote:** An estimate of the premium for an insurance policy, based on information provided by the potential policyholder. For example, when a customer inquires about homeowners insurance, our agency will provide a quote based on details about the home and the desired coverage.
- **Declaration Page:** This is a document provided by the insurance company detailing the specifics of the insurance policy. It includes information such as the policyholder's name, policy period, the amount of coverage, and the cost of the premium. It's often the first page of the policy documents and serves as a quick reference guide for the policyholder. For example, if a policyholder wants to verify the amount of their deductible, they can refer to the declaration page.
- **Insurance Binder:** A temporary agreement issued by an insurance agent or company that provides proof of insurance until a formal policy can be issued. For example, a binder may be issued to provide immediate coverage when a homeowner purchases a new home.
- **Grace Period:** The time after the premium due date during which the policy remains in force, even if the premium is not paid. The length of the grace period can vary depending on the policy and the insurance company, but it's typically 30 days. For example, if a policyholder forgets to pay their auto insurance premium on time, their coverage will not immediately lapse thanks to the grace period.

## Documentation and Forms
- **Certificate of Insurance (COI):** A document used to provide information on specific insurance coverage. For example, a contractor might need to provide a Certificate of Insurance to a client before starting work to prove they have the necessary liability insurance.
- **ACORD Forms:** Standardized forms used by insurance agencies and companies throughout the industry. For instance, when a client wants to cancel their previous policy, ACORD form 35 is required to be filled and signed by us and the client to be sent to the previous agency/carrier.
- **Forms (Coverage Selection/Rejection Forms and Exclusion Forms):** Documents used in the insurance application process. For example, in an auto policy, the policyholder may have a form where they can select or reject Uninsured Motorist coverage.
- **Application:** The document filled out by an agency on behalf of a prospective policyholder. For instance, someone seeking to purchase home insurance would provide the information to fill out an application with details about their home's value, location, construction, and safety features.
## Insurance Parties and Entities
- **Carrier:** Another term for the insurance company or insurer. This is the company that underwrites the insurance policy, setting the terms and pricing, and paying covered claims. Ex. Allstate, Geico, State Farm, Progressive, etc.
- **Named Insured(s):** The person or entity specifically protected by an insurance policy. This can be one or more individuals, corporations, or other entities. If a parent and child co-owns a car, both would be listed as named insureds on the auto policy.
- **Loss Payee:** A person or entity that is entitled to payment under the policy in the event of a claim. This is often a lender or leasing company that has a financial interest in the insured property. If a car is financed, the lender would be listed as a loss payee on the auto insurance policy. If a home has a mortgage, then the mortgage company would be listed.
- **Additional Insured:** A person or entity added to a policy at the policyholder's request. For example, a landlord might be listed as additional insured on a renter's insurance policy.
- **Citizens Property Insurance Corporation:** A not-for-profit, tax-exempt government entity that provides insurance protection to Florida property owners. It provides coverage to those who cannot find coverage in the private market.
## Policy and Coverage Terms
- **Wind Mitigation & 4-Point Inspections (Florida Homeowners Insurance):** These are specific inspections for Florida homeowners. Wind mitigation inspection can qualify a home for discounts on the windstorm portion of their homeowners insurance. A 4-point inspection is often required when purchasing a new homeowners policy or renewing an existing policy, focusing on the four main areas of a home: HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and roof.
- **Lapse:** The termination of an insurance policy due to non-payment of premiums. For example, if a policyholder forgets to pay their auto insurance premium, the policy could lapse, leaving the policyholder without coverage and a negative effect on their rates with future carriers (temporarily).
- **Policy Issuance (Issued vs Bound):** A policy is "issued" when it's fully underwritten and finalized by the insurance company. For example, once the policy is issued, the policyholder would receive the final policy documents. A policy is "bound" when the insurer has accepted the risk and confirmed coverage, often before the policy is formally issued. For instance, if a homeowner needs proof of insurance to close on a new home, the insurer could bind the coverage so the closing isn't delayed.
## Insurance Reports and Ratings
- **Loss History Report (LHR):** A record of insurance claims made by a policyholder. For example, if a homeowner has made several water damage claims in the past, this could be reflected in their loss history report and result in higher premiums.
- **Consumer Report:** Information gathered about an individual’s personal credit characteristics, character, reputation, and lifestyle used in the underwriting process. For example, an insurance company might use a consumer report to check a prospective policyholder's credit score (this shows up as a _soft_ check and doesn't hurt their credit).
- **Prior Insurance Report (PIR):** A report that shows whether a prospective policyholder had previous insurance coverage and often their limits. For instance, if a prospective policyholder has maintained continuous auto insurance coverage for several years, they could be eligible for a discount.
- **Rates (What They Are and How They're Determined):** Rates are the cost of a specific amount of insurance coverage, typically expressed as a rate per thousand dollars of coverage. They're determined based on risk factors correlated with potential losses. Factors can include location, age and type of property, and loss history.
- **Arbitration:** A process to settle a dispute between the insurance company and the insured or a third party without going to court. An impartial arbitrator reviews the evidence and makes a decision. For example, if a policyholder and the insurer cannot agree on the amount of a claim payout for the policyholder's car that was totaled out, they might use arbitration to resolve the dispute.
