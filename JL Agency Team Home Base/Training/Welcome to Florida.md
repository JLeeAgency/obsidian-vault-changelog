As a new team member of J Lee Insurance Agency, it's important to understand the unique challenges our clients face for insurance in order to meaningfully communicate with them.
# Florida P&C Insurance Industry Unique Aspects
Florida's property and casualty (P&C) insurance market has faced challenges in recent years, with some insurers becoming insolvent and others entering the market[1]. The state has a high risk of flooding and is known for its litigious environment, which has contributed to the challenges faced by the industry[3][9].
## Florida PIP Insurance Requirements
Florida is a no-fault state, which means drivers are legally required to have **personal injury protection (PIP)** insurance. **PIP covers 80% of necessary and reasonable medical expenses up to $10,000 resulting from a covered injury, regardless of who caused the crash**[2] **and this coverage pays first before other coverages kick in**. Though this would be a drop in the bucket for even a moderate injury, PIP was put into place to reduce the number of small-claims from minor injuries in accidents.
## Florida Flood Insurance Requirements
Florida does not require homeowners to have flood insurance by law, but if a property is located in a high-risk flood area and the mortgage is from a federally regulated bank, it is mandatory to carry flood insurance[7]. The state has recently implemented a precedent-setting bill requiring hundreds of thousands of property owners to buy flood insurance, regardless of whether they are in high-risk flood zones[3].
## Florida Homeowners Insurance Fraudulent Roof Claims
Florida's property insurance market has been affected by roofing scams, which have led to a crisis in the industry. Contractors offer to inspect homeowners' roofs for storm damage and then file fraudulent damage claims. When insurance companies refuse to pay, the contractors sue, and the insurance companies usually settle the disputed claims for many times more than the original claim[4]. This has resulted in significantly increased insurance premiums for homeowners[8].
## Florida Uninsured Motorist Coverage Differences
In Florida, uninsured motorist coverage is strictly for bodily injury, work loss, and pain and suffering, not damage to your vehicle if someone without insurance hits you[10]. This is a key difference from other states, where uninsured motorist coverage may also cover property damage.
