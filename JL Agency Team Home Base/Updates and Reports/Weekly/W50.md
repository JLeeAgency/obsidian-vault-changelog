- **Sales Tips**: Check out the [[Post-Sale Checklist Template]] that can be inserted into a note to keep track of what to do after a successful sale
- **Lead/Carrier Source Performance**: 

## 💡 Training and Development
- **This Week's Training Sessions**: 
	- **Katelyn**
- **New Hire Progress**: 
- **Continuing Education**: SAN of FL supplemental education materials; Katelyn already getting set up with Gail. I’ll let Gail know to also get Julia set up.

## 🛠️ Operational Updates
- **New Carriers/Products**: 
	- [[Hartford]] is officially out for personal auto until further notice. Though, I’ve never had a policy sold through them anyway in an entire year; their quotes for me haven’t been competitive despite what SAN says, so I may be missing something.
	- The agency has a direct appointment with [[Slide]] now! 🎉 Moving forward, please quote and write FIRE policies using my login credentials which should be shared on 1Password.
	  
- **System Updates**: Close CRM will be used until the 25th of this month, after which we’ll transition to Obsidian and a TBD VoIP platform (thinking either going back to [OpenPhone](https://www.openphone.com/) or [JustCall](https://justcall.io/)). I think this will be a good move in just having all of what we enter, look up, and do in one place. Also, I’ve been learning how flexible Obsidian really is, and it’s pretty impressive. I’ve spoken a bit about the tools we *actually* use and to what degree with Katelyn, which was massively helpful; so I encourage you two to continue with the feedback because self-reflection and improvement is what will set us apart from other agencies and drive our success.
  
- **Underwriting Memos**: There’s going to be a few policies to watch out for, which I’ll post in the [[7 - 🩺 Post-Sale Watchlist]].

## 🗣️ Feedback & Ideas
- **Team Shout-Outs**: Both of you, Julia and Katelyn, for being amazingly understanding and gracious about the current situation of the agency. Ever since I started insurance, I always believed most agents mistreat or underpay their team members for the work they do; this is often because most agents are actually never part of the daily operations and don’t know what it’s like on the front lines. So I promised myself I’d never be like that once my agency grows to that level, because I lost a lot of awesome co-workers and the agency’s productivity always suffered when there was a lot of turn over. So, I want you guys to have faith that if we can get over this phase and this plane takes off, I’ll make sure you guys are recognized and ride first-class.
  
- **Open Forum**: Share your ideas to improve our agency workflow, customer experience, etc.
[Idea might be worth looking into for client templates in Obsidian moving forward](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/13u66my/obsidian_as_crm_meta_bind_plugin_how_to_take/) ← I already installed this plugin, if you want to give this a try Katelyn

## 📌 Action Items for Next Week
- [ ] Ensure policies in the Post-Sale Watch list are in good standing and [[issuance|issued]] with the [[Closing the Loop|loop entirely closed]].
- [ ] 3 New quotes per day for me and Katelyn, no exceptions; we’re in survival mode.

## 💭 Closing Thoughts

Remember to keep your eye on the prize and the other on your customer. Together, we are unstoppable!
