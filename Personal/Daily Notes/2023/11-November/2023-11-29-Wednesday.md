## ðŸŒ…Morning Pages
> Face your problems as they come, one by one, give them the attention they need, and move on. Bundling them all together in a morass of confusion and letting them overwhelm you just won't help. It takes precision, patience, and discipline of thought. Work through each item pragmatically and with a solution in mind. Remember, everything is solvable, and if you can't see a solution, it only means you haven't worked it out yet.

**Still very relevant to my day today as well.**

## ðŸ“…Today...

- **What do you want to get done today?**
Catch up on my overdue quotes and application checks so I don't have a bunch of angry clients. Also even more important, follow ups with current clients reaching out to me.
- **What can wait?**
- **Obstacles in my way**

## ðŸ’­Train of Thoughts

- **02:25 PM** - Yeah wow, that Minerva app was actually a fucking huge pain in the ass to create a guide with. The premise is cool and ideal for my agency but it was just so *laggy* which caused steps to be accidentally deleted (which can't be recovered with undo) or steps to be reordered incorrectly. It even caused my browser to crash at one point. Another big thing, some screens show up all black which indicates bugs while handling split panels in browsers. Also, when switching tabs, the purple highlights persist even after the recording is finished; in fact, they persisted even after I removed the extension. My guide wasn't too large either, going from ~30 steps to 15 steps.
	- Doesn't appear to be a way to reach out to support or give feedback either; this is a red flag for Minerva.
	- It took me *an hour* from start record, submitting app, to finishing polishing the guide. That's far too long for one guide.
	  
- **02:36 PM** - Slightly important to do now, is picking an app for the agency's main [[Training Documentation]] platform, once and for all. But first handle [[V Soto]].
  
- **03:38 PM** - Cleaning out Close CRM Inbox, man it's a mess and I need to figure out the Lead classification system soon (i.e. condense old 'deals' into one 'lead') because one reply activates hella inbox follow ups and it stresses me out; it's hard to pick out the real tasks from the noise.
  
- **03:44 PM** - I gotta fix the Zapier integration for Close setting leads as "establishing contact", it affects customers who I'm just working up a cross-sale for. The solution is to make the zap similar to Todoist in that users can use Natural Language Processing Phrases to set fields/statuses/tags.
  
- [x] **Fix Zapier for Quote Sent Zap** #todo
- **03:47 PM** - [[Someday Maybe]] create a new note that is a reusable giant list of my train of thoughts in this same format but with days; possibly viewable/editable in the sidebars. Frees up clutter in my daily notes.
  
- **04:58 PM** Ok wow that was a rabbit hole, fixing the [[Zapier]] automation. A whole hour. Ok what do I need to get back doing.
  
- **05:48 PM** Followed up with Veterans Landscape Richard Kapp, and I'm a genius with these automations with new NLP for Close CRM tasks
  
- **06:38 PM** My mind is flittering between thoughts and to-dos and its causing me stress. Hunker down and tackle one at a time like my morning pages quote says. Eventually I'll get to a point of some level of clarity and ease.

## ðŸŒ™Daily Shutdown
