## 💭 Train of Thoughts/Notes
- **08:50 AM** - 
- **09:30 AM** - Gail Meeting
- **10:00 AM** - Finished meeting, trying to resolve tech issues but w/e
- **10:30 AM** - Forgot to note.
- **11:25 AM** - Agency performance/cash flow report for P’Kat
- **11:52 AM** - Call came in from the Delgados for auto quote request. Also just remembered I still need to work on [[Inbox/Enchanted Air LLC]] auto quote before noon.
- **04:00 PM** - Starting R Knapp resolution
- **04:54 PM** - Productive hour, resolved R Knapp, made leeway on B Will, resolved payroll. Time to start on Delgados quotes. Need to review prior coverages; might be as easy as just re-running through [[EZLynx]].
- **07:49 PM** - Ok, you already know where to start with this fixing of the cash flow report. Use the add-on to combine rows
I P A E L T R AG AC NP PB PA - ends on column L
- **08:40 PM** - Fixed July and confirmed correct column pattern. Which means Aug is missing columns too.<u> that or just delete columns.</u>
- Yeah that’s easier, Bill is deleted, invoice deleted.
Ok merge columns with duplicates for Name, Tran, AR, and LOB
- **09:12 PM** - This combination seems to have worked, each “household” shouldn’t have more than 4-5 different transaction types: NBS (new business), PCH (policy changes), XLC/XLN (cancellations), REI (reinstatements), STL, REW (rewrites).
