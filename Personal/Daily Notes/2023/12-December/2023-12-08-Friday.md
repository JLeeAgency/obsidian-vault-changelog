I have to switch to once per month pay for the agency, at least temporarily, to resolve dire cash flow issues this month. On what day for employees to be paid is the most attractive and favorable from an employee's or job seeker's standpoint? if 2nd to last day of month, 30th, 29th, and 28th were also options?
## 💭 Train of Thoughts/Notes
- **08:50 AM** - 
- **12:40 PM** - Sam called in, basically bound policy, but he got busy suddenly and wasn’t able to make payment. Sent text, pretty sure he’ll follow up with payment.
- **01:02 PM** - Ok, so Hubspot plus calling feature would be $50. Substantial improvement. And I don’t have to invest hella time into Obsidian besides client cards, which are still kind of useful.
- **01:05 PM** - Ok that’s a fucking hot improvement Jon, good job. 
- **01:05 PM** - After Superhuman, remember [[R Negrillo 🏠🚗]]. This is the second time she tried to contact us for a quote, that’s a pretty hot lead. Also, opportunity to test drive [[Hubspot]] start to finish.
- **02:30 PM** - Mind is slowing down pretty hard. But sales coming in, bound [[W Reutlinger]], what a nice guy.
