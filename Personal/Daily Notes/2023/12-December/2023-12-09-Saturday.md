## 🌅 Morning Pages
I just discovered it's probably a very good idea to test out writing *practical* morning pages, as in reflective content on my work and procedures, as opposed to personally reflective morning pages, as in feelings and perspectives. In a way, I can get out feelings and perspectives with practical morning pages, but it's more productive and contributory for my team now and future team members. For example, I'm stressed because for whatever reason [[H Lu]]‘s homeowners policy has an issue. It's always been on my to-do list to quantify my process in doing a [[pulse check]]. For this, I also need to illustrate what it means to [[Focus on the concepts first]]. A lot of which boils down to [[terminology in insurance]] and [[understanding process flows]]. There should be an [[if all else fails]] guide on how to contact underwriting or agency support (focus on only gathering the top 5 carrier partners for each LOB for the sake of time efficiency). And really I should knock out and finalize the quote for [[R Negrillo 🏠🚗]] before I continue on with his line of thought.

- [ ] Should also tidy up yesterday’s daily note on what was accomplished for gratitude and to keep track of what I’ve worked on.

## 💭 Train of Thoughts/Notes
- **03:01 PM** - Starting day. 
- **04:59 PM** - Remembered that I should have #step-by-step guides but also #real-time-demo guides. Loom is needed for this, ends on 2023-12-21, that should be sufficient time to get a good amount of demos in.
