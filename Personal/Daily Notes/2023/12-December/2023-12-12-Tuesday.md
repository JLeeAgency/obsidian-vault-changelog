#### What do you want to get done today? 
Training sessions with Katelyn and Julia. Housekeeping sweep for last months policies and renewing policies. Clean Quickbooks. Work 3 quotes.
#### What can wait? 
Housekeeping sweep, donâ€™t need to finish it all today at least. Quickbooks is a bit more of a priority.
#### What obstacles in my way?
Trying to fine-tune systems. My lack of sleep.
