## 🌅 Morning Pages

## 📅 Today...
#### What do you want to get done today? 
*Try 1 big, 2 medium, and 3 small tasks*
#### What can wait? 

#### What obstacles are in my way?

## 💭 Train of Thoughts/Notes
Sorting out Citizens depop issue for M Bellor. Speaking with a “Porsche”, she brought up that depop assumptions for the 20% rule might be using the renewal premium instead of current premium ($2,353); the renewal premium is $2,651.
