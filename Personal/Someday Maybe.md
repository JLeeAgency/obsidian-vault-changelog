# Someday Maybe 
Projects or tasks or wish lists that I'd like to tackle someday, maybe.

---

- **Add `@` as a user tag to the [[Close CRM]] Tasks created from Notes Zaps; they currently get auto-assigned to the lead owner.**
	- Also add recognition of time in the notes.
- **Set up google sheet with automation paired with Parseur to do my accounting for commissions**
	- [[Parseur]] already is set up to parse my incoming commission statements from SAN of FL; I should also look into setting it up for Citizens commission statements.  
~~- **Fix spacing between bullets in ObsidiMem**~~

- Zapier automation where if I receive an email from Fetch about new underwriting guideline bulletins, a browser agent can log into Fetch, get details of the bulletin, feed it into an google sheet or doc for me to batch summarize/simplify on a weekly basis with TypingMind and the [[Useful AI Prompts]] I created for this.
